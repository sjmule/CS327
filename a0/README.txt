README Assignment 0
This program creates an MPEG video representation of an implementation of Langton's ant.
This is done using two files, the first being langton327.c containing the main function of the program as well as a
separate function for movement.  And the second being encode.c containing the functions used for encoding the 
ant movement data into an MPEG.

Contained within this archive is a README, Changelog, Makefile, and the following source files:
langton327.c
encode.c
encode.h

Running make will compile the source files together into the executable main.
